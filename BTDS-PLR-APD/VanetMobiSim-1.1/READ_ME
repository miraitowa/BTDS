Installation and Compilation guide for VanetMobiSim

The Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks Mobility Simulator (VanetMobiSim) 
is a set of extensions to CanuMobiSim, a framework for user mobility 
modeling used by the CANU (Communication in Ad Hoc Networks for Ubiquitous Computing) 
Research Group, University of Stuttgart.

The Simulator has been created by the Institut Eur?com (France) and Politecnico di Torino (Italy)
within the NoE Newcom Project. 

In order to comply with the copyright of CanuMobiSim framework, we neither can diffuse the full 
binary code, nor the full source code of VanetMobiSim. 

However, the copyright allows us to diffuse the source code and extensions brought to CanuMobiSim by 
VanetMobiSim. Therefore, in order to obtain the binary code of the VanetMobiSim simulator, we let the
user patch CanuMobiSim source code with VanetMobiSim source code and finally compile the project.

The procedure is totally automatic and uses the power of Apache Ant.

1) Download the source code of VanetMobiSim and expand it in a base directory of your choice. You should get the following subdirectories and files:
   jar/
	 build.xml
	 VanetMobiSim-src.jar
	 VanetMobiSim-samples.jar
	 mypackages.lst
	 READ_ME
2) Go to the CanuMobiSim website  (http://canu.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mobisim/downloads/index.html)
   and download the CanuMobiSim source file. Expand it in the same directory. You should get 
	 a subdirectoy named "src/". At this time, your current directory should contains:
	 
	 jar/
	 src/
	 build.xml
	 VanetMobiSim-src.jar
	 VanetMobiSim-samples.jar
	 mypackages.lst
	 READ_ME

3) Open a terminal and go to your directory. Be sure that you have a working and well configured version of Apache Ant and that the build.xml file 
	 is in the base directory you will launch ant.
   Type:
	 "ant patch"
	 The program will patch the src/ directory with VanetMobiSim source files.
	 
4) Finally, in order to build the simulator and create the javadocs, type
   "ant all"
	 
	 Warnings generated by javadoc are not important. They are created because we do not distribute the source code of the geotransform java library 
	 (It may be found here: http://www.ai.sri.com/geotransform/)
	 
	 The binary .jar file of VanetMobiSim will be place in the jar/ subdirectory.
	 
5) You can now use VanetMobiSim according to the user manual.
